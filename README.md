# Calibration-and-Validation-of-Environmental-Low-Cost-Sensors-2025-Group19-
This project aims to monitor the environment by deploying low-cost Internet of Things (IoT) sensors. The core task is to validate the accuracy of these low-cost sensors using high-precision ones. If systematic errors are found, the low-cost sensors will be calibrated to correct their measurement data during operation, ensuring data reliability.
